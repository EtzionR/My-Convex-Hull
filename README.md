## My-Convex-Hull
Convex Hull Algorithm, build from scratch ,using the Monotone-Chain method.

## Overview
The algorithm works by **Four** steps:
- In order to get the boundary around our 2D points, we must first **sorting** the points, using to their X values.

- Now, we will **divide the calculation**, so that it focuses on a different hull each time, once on the top and once on the bottom, as follows:

- We perform the calculation for each such sub-boundary (hull). In order to verify that this we take the desired path, we use **invalid function** (lambda function). This function identifies for each point if there is a better route to it. When a "better path" means relativity lower slope than the slope to the previous point. You can see such example in the following figure:

<br />These properties converted into an equations, which can be developed into our **invalid function**:

Equations

- After the calculation of the top & bottom hulls, all we need is **merge** them to one final hull.

It should be noted that the example is given from the calculation of the lower limit. The function also works in the upper limit calculation, where there is the fact that we are operating on the reverse list. The inversion of the coordinates ensures a negative denominator in the slope always, which makes the left slope negative and the right positive if there is a better trajectory.

Now, it is also possible to calculate the area of the generated polygon. The calculation is performed using the following equations, which are used to calculate an irregular polygon area:

You can also see a simple example of how the calculation is done:

Also, the results of the algorithm can also be generated as an output in a simple way using a built-in function:

``` sh

```
